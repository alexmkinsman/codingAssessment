Timed Code Assessment
For this project I created a timed coding quiz which gives immediate feedback about whether the user answered the question right, shows only one question at a time, has a timer that continuously counts down, stores score and initials, and has a page which will display previous high scores. This tests my ability to use several different documents and link them all to create a streamlined and efficient website. 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
